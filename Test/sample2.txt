I did come up with this when working on a quick log parsing script
that needed to accumulate data during the log parsing and I felt that
it would nice to try doing this using js and node instead of using perl or bash.
Anyway, I do feel that small nodejs scripts should be self contained
and not rely on third party modules so after reading all the answers
to this question, each using various modules to handle line parsing,
a 13 SLOC native nodejs solution might be of interest .
